# Ciphers
Presented here are a variety of cryptographic ciphers, each with encryption and decryption ability.

Each cipher accepts a string and encrypts/decrypts that string using a key. The user may choose to use a randomly generated encryption key by inputting 'random' as the key.

Implemented ciphers include:
* Caesar cipher
* Transposition cipher
* Affine cipher
* VigenÃ¨re cipher
* Substitution cipher

# How to use
Each cipher may be executed without arguments. The user will then be prompted for a message, whether they want the message encrypted or decrypted, and a key.
Alternatively, each cipher may be called by name and optionally accepts 3 arguments (in the following order): `message`, `decrypt/encrypt`, `key` (or key size). Depending on the cipher being used, the key format may differ.

If cipher operation and/or key are not provided, the user will be prompted for them. Otherwise, the cipher will immediately begin operating.

Examples:

```python
from affine import affine
vigenere('This is a test message', 'e', 1696)
L0ig ig U yBgy ~BggU.B
```

```bash
./vigenere.py encrypt this message
Encrypt/Decrypt (e/d)?: e
Enter an encryption/decryption key: blastoise
fycjrdb lljd mwlgiyi
```

```bash
python transposition.py
Enter a string to be encrypted/decrypted using the transposition cipher
> cryptography is cool
Encrypt/Decrypt (e/d)?: e
Enter an encryption/decryption key: 6
cg orrilyaspp thcoyo
```

Alternatively, run main.py from a command line for a user-friendly interface, which also allows access to additional options for sequential encryption and code breaking.

# To-do
* Implement built-in brute force decryption
* Detect english words in brute force decryption efforts and present candidate strings to the user
